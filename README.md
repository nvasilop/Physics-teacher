This is a beginner Codecademy python project!

In this project I am a  physic's teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. I want to provide my students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

I defined python's functions and I do mathematical's calculations. 
Finally, I printed out the results of each calculation along with appropriate messages to provide context.
